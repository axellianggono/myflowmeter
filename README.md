MyFlowMeter
===========
This project is a flow-based network traffic feature extractor inspired by
CICFlowMeter. It processes network packets (from PCAP files or live capture),
groups them into bidirectional flows, and extracts statistical features commonly
used in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and network traffic analysis.

The main goal of this project is educational and research-oriented, focusing on
understanding how CICFlowMeter-style features are derived algorithmically and
implemented in practice using Python and PyShark.

Quick Start
-----------
* Capture a pcap file
